When hangboarding, I keep searching again and again for the edge sizes of both Beastmakers (the most common hangboards).
It's easy to find, and the best source is (as expected) on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbharder/comments/cek236/beastmaker_1000_and_2000_edgehold_sizes/).

There is, however, not a single picture showing both boards next to each other, and having to scroll through tables sucks.
So I doodled them in [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com).
