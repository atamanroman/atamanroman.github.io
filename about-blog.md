title: About the Blog

I rarely post here but often write (unpublished) notes for myself.
Most of the things have already been said.
But sometimes I learn something which is not easily found online - then I post here ðŸ˜…

Also, in the context of the massive X/Twitter implosion and lack of good alternatives (sorry, [mastodon](https://mastodon.social), I tried!), I might start sharing links for reference here.

## Technical Stuff

This blog is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), DNS happens at [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com).
The theme in use is [riggraz/no-style-please](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please) [(LICENSE)](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please/blob/master/LICENSE.txt), but I replaced the CSS with my own, minimal version.

The font in use for the body is [Zilla Slab via Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Zilla+Slab).
Sorry for the (optional) Google dependency.
Code tags and blocks are in [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/), though!
I gladly paid them $75 - I use Berkeley Mono basically everywhere on my machine and now even on this page (kindly permitted by the [personal developer license](https://cdn.berkeleygraphics.com/static/legal/licenses/developer-license.pdf)).
