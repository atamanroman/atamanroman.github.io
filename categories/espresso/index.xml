Shots were often inconsistent but getting better. But since I got my bottomless portafilter, I just couldnâ€™t get anything right. 80%+ of my pulls were channeling like crazy and I ended up with 1:4 in 20s or so. I tried everything. Finer, coarser, different espressos, high doses, low doses, different tamping pressures, different basket sizes. Barely any effect. Only very high doses and high-pressure tamps made it a little better.</description></item></channel></rss>
