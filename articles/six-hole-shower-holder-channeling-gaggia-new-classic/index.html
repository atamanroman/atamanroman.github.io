<a href=/tags/espresso>espresso</a><div><p>I&rsquo;ve got my Gaggia New Classic for 3 months now.
Shots were often inconsistent but getting better.
But since I got my bottomless portafilter, I just couldn’t get anything right.
80%+ of my pulls were channeling like crazy and I ended up with 1:4 in 20s or so.
I tried everything.
Finer, coarser, different espressos, high doses, low doses, different tamping pressures, different basket sizes.
Barely any effect.
Only very high doses and high-pressure tamps made it a little better.
Still awful.</p><p>1.5 kg of coffee later, it hit me.
Every puck looked the same: a massive hole at 1&rsquo;o clock.</p><p><img src=channeling.jpeg alt="Two Examples of Channeling at 1&rsquo;o Clock"></p><p>That made me curious.
I checked the shower screen, cleaned it and did the same with the holder.
Played with screw tightness.
Checked water distribution and flow.
Everything looked good.
But then I remembered that I changed the plate holder from the stock 4 hole aluminum one to a <a href=https://www.verybarista.com/collections/frontpage/products/custom-stainless-steel-tune-up-kit-for-gaggia-shower-holder-ims-precision-basket-cafelat-gasket-screws>6 hole stainless-steel one</a>.
Not because I needed to, but because I got it in a set pretty cheap.
More holes, more better - right?</p><p><strong>After changing it back to the stock one the problem is gone.</strong>
First I thought the 1&rsquo;o clock hole aligns with the water stream.
But that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case. Maybe they are to far on the edge of the puck.
To be honest, I don&rsquo;t quite get it.</p><p>But at least I&rsquo;m consistently getting decent coffee again.</p><p>By the way, I&rsquo;m not the only one having this issue.
